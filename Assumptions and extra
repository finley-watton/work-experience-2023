# work-experience-2023
the assumptions i  made where that the hight , lenght of walls, have been previously measured and the room has a plan to allowing for the plotting of its pionts on a graph.
if i had more time i would have finished a program i had been working on to find the pionts and lenght of the walls by being given the lenght of individual walls and the angles between them.
i would have also made the code more presentable with more of the code in seperate functions.
projects related to obtaining a place to work for work experience.
